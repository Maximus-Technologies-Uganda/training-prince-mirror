**Tests Status**: 36/36 E2E + 287/287 Unit tests passing

## Acceptance Boxes

### Stopwatch Core Controls
- [x] Start button begins timer and updates UI state
- [x] Stop button pauses timer and preserves elapsed time
- [x] Reset button clears timer display and lap list
- [x] Lap button records laps only while timer is running

### Persistence & State Recovery

- [x] Session-only mode handled gracefully if localStorage unavailable

### Lap Display & Export

- [x] Lap button debounced (100ms) to prevent duplicate entries
- [x] CSV export downloads with correct headers and HH:MM:SS formatting
- [x] CSV filename includes timestamp (e.g., `stopwatch_export_*.csv`)

### Accessibility (All 5 UIs)
- [x] Text contrast meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large)
- [x] Keyboard navigation order is logical for controls
- [x] Buttons and inputs have accessible labels/announcements
- [x] Focus indicators visible and meet contrast requirements

### Testing & Coverage
- [x] Vitest unit coverage ≥40% for `frontend/src/ui-stopwatch/` (achieved 73.92%)
- [x] Playwright smoke test covers start → lap → stop → export workflow
- [x] No console errors or uncaught exceptions during tests
