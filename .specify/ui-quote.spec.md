# UI Quote
## Why
User sees a random quote and can filter by author.
## Non-goals
No persistence or external APIs this week.
## Acceptance
[x] Default view shows a quote on load.
[x] Typing an author filters quotes (case-insensitive).
[x] Error state is visible when author not found.
[x] Keyboard focus order is logical; interactive controls labelled.
