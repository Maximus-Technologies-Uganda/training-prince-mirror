# UI Quote
## Why
User sees a random quote and can filter by author.
## Non-goals
No persistence or external APIs this week.
## Acceptance
[] Default view shows a quote on load.
[] Typing an author filters quotes (case-insensitive).
[] Error state is visible when author not found.
[] Keyboard focus order is logical; interactive controls labelled.
