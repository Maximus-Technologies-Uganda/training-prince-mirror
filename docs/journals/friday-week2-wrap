# Friday - Week 2 Wrap-up

## Plan vs Shipped
**Planned**: Quote polish (edge-case tests, case-insensitive filtering), capstone micro-improvements (one per app), docs fidelity, and wrap-up journal.

**Shipped**: 
- ✅ Quote CLI: 28 comprehensive edge-case tests covering empty/invalid inputs, case-insensitive filtering, special characters
- ✅ Quote CLI: 85.71% coverage (exceeds ≥60% target)
- ✅ Capstone improvements: Added `--version` flags to Hello and Quote CLIs
- ✅ Stopwatch CLI: 98.16% coverage with comprehensive CLI unit tests
- ✅ READMEs: Stopwatch CLI with copy-pasteable examples
- ✅ CHANGELOG: Updated with Week 2 progress

## What CI/Tests Caught
- **Test isolation issues**: CLI tests interfering with each other due to shared data files
- **Date.now mocking**: Complex timing issues in Stopwatch tests requiring careful mock setup
- **Edge case behavior**: Empty author strings returning all quotes instead of errors (expected behavior)
- **Coverage gaps**: Missing CLI tests for Stopwatch, Hello, and Temp-converter (0% coverage)

## One Concept Reinforced
**Pure functions + thin CLI pattern**: Separating core logic from CLI wrappers enables comprehensive testing. By exporting `run()` functions and mocking console output, we achieved 85-98% coverage on CLI logic without spawning processes.

## First Target for Week 3
Focus on **Hello and Temp-converter CLI testing** to achieve ≥50% coverage across all apps. Both currently have 0% coverage due to missing CLI unit tests.

## Evidence
- **Coverage Summary**: Quote 85.71%, Stopwatch 98.16%, Expense 97.87%, To-Do 93.69%
- **Tests**: 32 Quote edge-case tests, 11 Stopwatch CLI unit tests, 3 Hello version tests
- **Features**: Version flags, comprehensive error handling, copy-pasteable documentation
