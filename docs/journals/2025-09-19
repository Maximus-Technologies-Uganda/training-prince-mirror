## Goals for Today
- [x] Implement the Expense Tracker CLI.
- [x] Write unit tests for the core logic.
- [x] Open and merge the PR for the feature.
- [x] Complete daily journal entry.

## Commands / Steps I tried
- `git checkout -b feat/cli-expense`
- `npm install`
- `npm test`
- `node src/expense/index.js add --amount 100 --category food`

## PRs & CI
- **PR:** <link to your merged 'feat/cli-expense' PR>
- **CI:** <link to the successful 'checks' run for that PR>

## What I learned
- How to handle different commands (`add`, `list`, `total`) from the command line using a `switch` statement.
- How to read from and write to a JSON file using Node.js's `fs` module to persist data.
