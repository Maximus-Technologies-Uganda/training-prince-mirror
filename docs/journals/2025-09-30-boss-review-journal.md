## Daily Report – Conflict Resolution and CI Hardening

**Date**: 2025-09-30  
**Engineer**: Prince Buyinza  
**Mentor**: Paul Mwanje  
**Repo**: `training-prince` (private) → `training-prince-mirror` (public)

---

### Executive Summary
Resolved PR merge conflicts blocking `feature/LIN-QUO-quote-cli` → `development`. Hardened the mirror CI workflow to prefer SSH deploy keys with an HTTPS token fallback. Consolidated `.gitignore` to capture runtime JSON files and local tool directories. All tests pass (222/222). Branch pushed and conflicts cleared for merge.

---

### What Changed Today

- CI Workflow: `.github/workflows/sync-to-public-mirror.yml`
  - Prefer SSH deploy key (`DEPLOY_KEY`) when present
  - Fallback to HTTPS using `MIRROR_TOKEN` if SSH is absent
  - Added `workflow_dispatch` for manual runs
  - Conditions reference `secrets.*` to avoid false negatives

- Repository Hygiene: `.gitignore`
  - Kept `.cursor/` and `review-artifacts/`
  - Added runtime JSON ignores: `data/*.json`, `coverage-summary.json`, `stopwatch-state.json`, `expenses.json`, `todo.json`

- Validation
  - Ran full test suite with Vitest: 222/222 passing
  - Pushed commits to `feature/LIN-QUO-quote-cli`

---

### Impact

- CI mirroring is reliable with least-privilege tokens and first-class SSH support
- Cleaner repository diffs; no accidental JSON state or artifacts committed
- PR is unblocked for merge; no changes to application behavior

---

### Evidence

- Commit SHAs: included in branch `feature/LIN-QUO-quote-cli` (latest push today)
- Tests: 222/222 passing locally
- Files updated: `.github/workflows/sync-to-public-mirror.yml`, `.gitignore`

---

### Next Steps

- Merge PR once checks complete
- Verify mirror repo receives forced updates for `main` and `development`
- If needed, rotate `MIRROR_TOKEN` and register SSH deploy key with write access on the mirror

---

### Notes for Management

No scope creep; the work was corrective and hygiene-oriented. Risk reduced on CI secrets handling; documentation and ignore rules now aligned with actual toolchain and generated data.
