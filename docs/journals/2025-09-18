## Goals for Today
- [x] Design and implement core logic for Stopwatch CLI using TDD.
- [x] Write unit tests for time formatting and lap behavior (3 total).
- [x] Open a PR with passing tests and get it merged.
- [x] Complete daily journal entry.

## Commands / Steps I tried
- `git checkout -b feat/cli-stopwatch`
- `touch tests/stopwatch.test.js`
- `npm test`

## PRs & CI
- **PR:** <link to your merged 'feat/cli-stopwatch' PR>
- **CI:** <link to the successful 'checks' run for that PR>

## Bugs & Fixes
- **Symptom:** Tests were failing with `ReferenceError: createStopwatch is not defined`.
- **Root Cause:** A persistent file saving issue in the editor meant the test runner was executing an old version of the `src/stopwatch/core.js` file that was missing the `export` keyword and the new function.
- **Fix:** Used the `cat` command to verify the file's true contents, which revealed a final syntax error (a missing newline). Adding the newline and re-saving the file finally resolved the issue.

## What I learned
- The Test-Driven Development (TDD) cycle: Red -> Green -> Refactor.
- How to debug persistent errors by verifying the "ground truth" of files directly in the terminal.

## Plan for Tomorrow
- Begin the Expense Tracker CLI.
