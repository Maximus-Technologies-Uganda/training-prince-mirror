# Feature Specification: UI Stopwatch with CSV Export

**Feature Branch**: `003-build-a-ui`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a UI for the `stopwatch` application with Start, Stop, and Reset buttons, plus an "Export CSV" feature for lap data. The UI must use the existing core logic. Why: To provide a simple graphical interface for timing events and exporting lap data. Acceptance: - Vitest tests for CSV output (golden file and empty state). - Playwright smoke test for start/stop functionality. - ‚â•40% statement coverage for the `ui-stopwatch` module."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to control a stopwatch through a simple UI (Start, Stop, Reset) and export recorded laps to CSV so I can measure and share timing results.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the stopwatch is idle at 00:00.000, When I click Start, Then the elapsed time begins increasing and the Start button disables (or toggles to Stop).
2. Given the stopwatch is running, When I click Stop, Then elapsed time freezes and the Stop button disables (or toggles to Start).
3. Given the stopwatch has been started at least once, When I click Reset, Then elapsed time returns to 00:00.000 and laps are cleared.
4. Given I have captured one or more laps, When I click Export CSV, Then a CSV file is produced with headers and one row per lap in a stable column order.
5. Given there are no laps, When I click Export CSV, Then the CSV contains only headers with no data rows.
6. Given the stopwatch is running, When I capture a lap, Then the lap is added to the list with an increasing index and accurate timestamps relative to start.

### Edge Cases
- Starting when already running should have no effect and not duplicate timers.  
- Stopping when already stopped should have no effect.  
- Reset while running should be blocked or require confirmation [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confirm reset behavior during run].  
- Exporting CSV with special characters in lap labels should properly escape values.  
- Very long runs (hours) should keep formatting consistent and not degrade UI responsiveness.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Users MUST be able to Start the stopwatch from an idle or stopped state.
- **FR-002**: Users MUST be able to Stop the stopwatch from a running state.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to Reset the stopwatch; resetting returns elapsed time to zero and clears laps.
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to capture laps while running; laps are recorded in order captured.
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to Export CSV of laps with header row and one row per lap.
- **FR-006**: The UI MUST use existing core stopwatch logic from `src/stopwatch/` (no duplication of domain logic).
- **FR-007**: The UI MUST display elapsed time with millisecond precision and consistent formatting.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST prevent duplicate timers or inconsistent state transitions (e.g., Start while already running).
- **FR-009**: The system MUST provide Playwright smoke test for start/stop flow.
- **FR-010**: The `ui-stopwatch` module MUST achieve ‚â•40% statement coverage measured by Vitest; include coverage in CI review packet.
- **FR-011**: The CSV export MUST be verified by Vitest via golden file comparison and empty-state snapshot.
- **FR-012**: Time computation MUST rely on an injectable clock abstraction for deterministic tests [reuse pattern from ui-todo].

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)
- **StopwatchState**: elapsedMs (number), isRunning (boolean), laps (Lap[]), startedAt (timestamp|null).
- **Lap**: index (number), timestampMs (number), deltaMs (number), label (optional string).
