# Feature Specification: UI — To-Do

**Feature Branch**: `009-feat-ui-todo`  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Status**: Ready  
**Input**: User description: "feat(ui-todo): Implement the To-Do UI"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-14
- Q: How is “high priority” defined for the to-do items? → A: Boolean flag `isHighPriority`; filter shows tasks where the flag is true.
- Q: What lifecycle statuses can a to-do item occupy (so we know what counts as an invalid toggle)? → A: Two states: `active` and `completed`.
- Q: What granularity should the due date use when evaluating “due today”? → A: Calendar date only (YYYY-MM-DD) matched against the clock abstraction’s current date.
- Q: When a user tries to add a duplicate task, how should the UI inform them? → A: Inline error message near the add form; task list remains unchanged.
- Q: When a user removes a task, do we need a confirmation step? → A: No confirmation; removal is immediate, actions are undoable via core logic.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a busy person managing daily commitments, I want to record my tasks, track which ones are due today or high priority, and mark them complete so that I stay organized and focused on what matters most.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the to-do list is empty, **When** I enter a unique task with due date and priority and submit it, **Then** the task appears in the list with its current status set to active and the form clears.
2. **Given** a task is present in the list, **When** I toggle its completion state, **Then** the task's visual state updates immediately and reflects in any active filters without page reload.
3. **Given** a task exists, **When** I remove it from the list, **Then** it disappears immediately and the list re-renders without manual refresh.
4. **Given** multiple tasks have due dates and priorities, **When** I apply the "due-today" filter, **Then** only tasks whose calendar date matches today remain visible and the filter checkbox shows as checked.
5. **Given** multiple tasks with varying priority levels, **When** I enable the "high-priority" filter, **Then** only tasks marked as high priority remain visible alongside any other active filters, and the count updates immediately.

### Edge Cases
- Duplicate entry attempt is blocked with inline error feedback near the add form while keeping the original task intact.
- Tasks whose due date is near the daily boundary respect the shared clock abstraction so tests can emulate “today” via calendar date comparison.
- Toggling a task already in the requested state provides clear feedback and leaves the list unchanged, reinforcing the two-state (`active`/`completed`) lifecycle.
- Removing a task that is currently filtered out still succeeds, refreshes visible results immediately, and relies on the core’s undo mechanics instead of a confirmation prompt.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The UI MUST allow users to add new to-do items with the fields required by the existing core logic (title, due date, priority, status managed by core).
- **FR-002**: The UI MUST prevent creating duplicate to-do items according to the uniqueness rules enforced by the core and display an inline error adjacent to the add form.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to toggle the completion state of any task between `active` and `completed` and see the updated state immediately.
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to remove a task and see the list refresh without manual reload; removal occurs immediately with no confirmation dialog, deferring any undo capability to the core logic.
- **FR-005**: The UI MUST provide independent filters for "due-today" and "high-priority" that can be combined, with "high-priority" evaluating the core-provided boolean `isHighPriority` flag.
- **FR-006**: The UI MUST reuse the shared clock abstraction when determining "due today" so automated tests can simulate different days by matching calendar dates.
- **FR-007**: The UI MUST reuse business logic from `src/todo/core.js` module for all task mutations and queries; no duplicate business rules are introduced.
- **FR-008**: The UI MUST surface validation or state errors returned from the core so users know why an action failed, including attempts to toggle to the same state.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ToDoItem**: Represents a single task with attributes such as title, due date (calendar date), boolean `isHighPriority`, completion status, and any identifiers required by the core.
- **FilterState**: Captures the active filters (due-today, high-priority) and relies on the shared clock abstraction to determine the effective "today" boundary by comparing calendar dates.
