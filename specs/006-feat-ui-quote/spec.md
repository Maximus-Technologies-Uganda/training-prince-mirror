# Feature Specification: UI Quote - Random + Filter by Author

**Feature Branch**: `006-feat-ui-quote`  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a simple UI that displays a random quote and allows a user to filter quotes by author, with unit and E2E smoke tests; reuse backend quote core; ‚â•40% UI coverage."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-13
- Q: How should the author filter be triggered? ‚Üí A: Live filter as the user types.
- Q: How should the ‚Äúno results‚Äù state be shown? ‚Üí A: Replace quote text with ‚ÄúNo quotes found‚Äù.
- Q: Where should the input be placed and how labeled for accessibility? ‚Üí A: Above quote; label ‚ÄúAuthor‚Äù.
- Q: How should seeded RNG be provided for unit tests? ‚Üí A: Mock RNG globally (Math.random) in tests.
- Q: What should the Playwright smoke test validate beyond page load? ‚Üí A: Typing an author updates the displayed quote.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a site visitor, I want to see a random quote on page load and filter by author (case-insensitive) so I can view quotes from specific authors.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the page loads, **When** no input is provided, **Then** a random quote is displayed.
2. **Given** an author exists, **When** their name (any case) is typed into the filter, **Then** the displayed quote updates to one by that author (validated via Playwright smoke test).
3. **Given** no quotes for a typed author, **When** filtering yields zero results, **Then** replace the quote text with the message ‚ÄúNo quotes found‚Äù.

### Edge Cases
- Empty input restores random quote behavior.
- Leading/trailing spaces in input are ignored.
- Case-insensitivity: "maya angelou" matches "Maya Angelou".

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Page MUST display a random quote on load. [81]
- **FR-002**: UI MUST include a text input to filter quotes by author. [81]
- **FR-003**: Author filtering MUST be case-insensitive. [81]
- **FR-004**: UI MUST import and use existing backend `quote` core logic (no duplication). [82]
 - **FR-005**: Filter MUST trigger live on input (results update as the user types).
 - **FR-006**: When zero matches, the UI MUST display ‚ÄúNo quotes found‚Äù in place of the quote.
 - **FR-007**: Place the author input above the quote with a visible label ‚ÄúAuthor‚Äù linked via for/id and accessible to screen readers.
 - **FR-008**: Unit tests MUST mock `Math.random` with a seeded RNG to ensure deterministic results for random quote selection.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Quote**: { text: string, author: string }
