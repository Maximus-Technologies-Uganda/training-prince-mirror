# Feature Specification: Tuesday: Spec-First Polishing for Quote and Temp UIs

**Feature Branch**: `012-title-tuesday-spec`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Title: Tuesday: Spec-First Polishing for Quote and Temp UIs

Context: This specification outlines the first feature development task for Week 4, focusing on polishing the user experience, error handling, and testability of the Quote and Temperature Converter UIs. All work must follow the strict spec-driven development process defined in the workbook. We will create formal spec files, implement the required UI improvements, and ensure comprehensive testing before merging.

Core Requirements:

Quote UI Polishing :

Improved Filter UX: The author filter input must be enhanced to be case-insensitive and should use a debounce mechanism of 200-300ms to prevent excessive re-rendering while the user is typing.

Error State: Implement a clear and friendly error state that is displayed when a user filters for an author that is not found.

Deterministic Testing: The logic for selecting a random quote must be updated to accept a seeded Random Number Generator (RNG) to ensure that tests are deterministic and repeatable.

Temp UI Polishing :

Input Validation: The temperature input field must be restricted to accept only numeric characters.

Error States:

Display a clear error message if the user attempts to convert between two identical units (e.g., Celsius to Celsius).

Clarity and Formatting:

The UI must clearly display the unit labels (e.g., ¬∞C, ¬∞F) for the input and output values.

All conversion results must be rounded to a clear and consistent precision of 1-2 decimal places.

Testing Requirements :

Unit Tests (Vitest):

For the Quote UI, implement table-driven tests for the author filter logic.

For the Temp UI, add tests covering Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversion, Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion, the identical unit error case, and attempts to use non-numeric input.

E2E Tests (Playwright):

Create or update a smoke test for the Quote UI that verifies the quote list updates correctly when a user types in the filter input.

Create or update a smoke test for the Temp UI that verifies the output value updates correctly upon input change.

Process & Documentation:

Spec Files: All work must be traceable to new specification files: /.specify/ui-quote.spec.md and /.specify/ui-temp.spec.md. The spec stub from the workbook should be used for the quote spec.


Pull Request: The final pull request must adhere to all project conventions, including links to the ticked spec files, a Figma Dev Mode link, "How to test" instructions, an artifact link, and a coverage table .

Definition of Done:

The Quote UI filter is debounced and case-insensitive.

The Temp UI validates for numeric input and handles identical-unit conversions with a clear error.

All new Vitest and Playwright tests are implemented and passing in CI.

The pull request is submitted and successfully merged, with all required documentation and links present.

The acceptance boxes in both spec.md files are ticked."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27
- Q: What should happen when a user clears the quote filter field (empty input)? ‚Üí A: Show all quotes (default state)
- Q: What should happen when temperature input contains decimal points or negative signs? ‚Üí A: Allow decimal points and negative signs (e.g., -32.5)
- Q: What should happen when extreme temperature values are entered (e.g., very large numbers like 999999 or very small like -999999)? ‚Üí A: No specific limits, rely on browser/JavaScript limits
- Q: What should happen when whitespace-only input is entered in the quote filter? ‚Üí A: Treat whitespace as empty and show all quotes
- Q: What should happen when the debounce timer is still active and the user types more characters? ‚Üí A: Cancel previous timer, start new timer

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user interacting with the Quote and Temperature Converter UIs, I want improved user experience, better error handling, and reliable functionality so that I can efficiently find quotes and convert temperatures without encountering confusing errors or performance issues.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is viewing the Quote UI, **When** they type in the author filter field, **Then** the filter should be case-insensitive and debounced to prevent excessive re-rendering
2. **Given** a user searches for a non-existent author in the Quote UI, **When** no quotes match their filter, **Then** a clear and friendly error message should be displayed
3. **Given** a user is viewing the Temperature Converter UI, **When** they enter non-numeric characters, **Then** the input should be restricted to numeric characters only
4. **Given** a user selects the same unit for both input and output in the Temperature Converter, **When** they attempt to convert, **Then** a clear error message should be displayed
5. **Given** a user enters a valid temperature value, **When** they convert between different units, **Then** the result should be clearly formatted with unit labels and rounded to 1-2 decimal places

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user types very quickly in the quote filter (debounce behavior)? (Cancel previous timer, start new timer)
- How does the system handle empty or whitespace-only filter inputs? (Show all quotes when filter is cleared or whitespace-only)
- What happens when temperature input contains decimal points or negative signs? (Allow both decimals and negatives)
- How does the system handle extreme temperature values? (Rely on browser/JavaScript limits)
- What happens when the random quote selection needs to be deterministic for testing?
