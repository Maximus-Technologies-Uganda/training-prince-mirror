# Feature Specification: UI To‚ÄëDo Management

**Feature Branch**: `001-what-build-a`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Approved  
**Input**: Build a UI for the to‚Äëdo application with add, toggle, remove; filters for
"due‚Äëtoday" and "high‚Äëpriority"; require a clock abstraction for deterministic tests;
wire UI to existing todo core logic.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: What timezone should define ‚Äútoday‚Äù for the due‚Äëtoday filter? ‚Üí A: Fixed TZ: Africa/Kampala (UTC+3)
- Q: Should duplicate detection treat ‚ÄúBuy milk‚Äù and ‚Äúbuy  milk‚Äù as the same? ‚Üí A: Case-insensitive and collapse internal whitespace
- Q: What should happen when removing an item while a filter is active? ‚Üí A: Remove from the underlying list; keep current filter applied
- Q: How should invalid due dates entered by the user be handled? ‚Üí A: Block add with inline error, keep input
- Q: Should to-dos persist across page reloads? ‚Üí A: No, in-memory for now

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to manage my to‚Äëdos in a simple UI so I can add tasks, mark them
complete, remove them, and quickly focus on items due today or marked high priority.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the to‚Äëdo list is empty, When I add "Buy milk" with due date today and
   priority high, Then I see the new item in the list with correct attributes.
2. Given an existing incomplete to‚Äëdo, When I toggle it, Then it becomes completed
   and is visually indicated as such.
3. Given an existing completed to‚Äëdo, When I toggle it, Then it becomes incomplete
   and is visually indicated as such.
4. Given multiple items with varying due dates, When I apply the "due‚Äëtoday" filter,
   Then only items whose due date equals "today" per the clock abstraction are shown.
5. Given multiple items with different priorities, When I apply the "high‚Äëpriority"
   filter, Then only items marked high priority are shown.
6. Given an existing item with text "Buy milk", When I try to add another item with
   the exact same text, Then I am prevented from adding a duplicate and see an error.

### Edge Cases
- Adding an empty or whitespace‚Äëonly task should be rejected with a clear message.
- Duplicate detection is case‚Äëinsensitive with whitespace normalization (trim +
  collapse internal sequences).
- "Due‚Äëtoday" boundary uses the provided clock abstraction in timezone
  Africa/Kampala (UTC+3); items exactly at 00:00 or 23:59 of "today" are included as
  due today.
- Toggling from an invalid state (e.g., missing item, out‚Äëof‚Äëbounds index) is
  rejected with a clear error state without mutating list data.
- Removing an item under an active filter removes it from the source list and keeps
  the current filter applied; the filtered view updates without switching modes.
- Invalid or unparsable due dates block the add action; an inline error is shown and
  the current input values are preserved for user correction.
- Reloading the page clears the current to‚Äëdo list (no persistence).

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Users MUST be able to add a to‚Äëdo with text, optional due date, and
  optional priority (default normal).
- **FR-002**: Users MUST be able to toggle completion status of an existing to‚Äëdo.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to remove an existing to‚Äëdo. Removal MUST update the
  list while preserving the current filter mode (no reset to All).
- **FR-004**: UI MUST provide a "due‚Äëtoday" filter that uses a clock abstraction with
  fixed timezone Africa/Kampala (UTC+3) to determine "today" deterministically.
- **FR-005**: UI MUST provide a "high‚Äëpriority" filter to view only high‚Äëpriority items.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST prevent adding duplicate tasks (same text after
  normalization: trim, collapse internal whitespace, and case-insensitive compare).
- **FR-007**: Invalid state transitions (e.g., toggling a non‚Äëexistent item) MUST be
  guarded and leave state unchanged with a clear user feedback.
- **FR-008**: UI MUST reuse existing core logic from `src/todo/` for domain
  behavior (add, toggle, remove, validation) without duplicating logic.
- **FR-009**: A Playwright smoke flow MUST add a new item and then toggle it
  successfully in a running build.
- **FR-010**: The `ui-todo` module MUST achieve ‚â•40% statement coverage (unit tests)
  measured by Vitest; coverage MUST be included in the CI review‚Äëpacket.
- **FR-011**: The PR MUST link to the `review-packet` artifact and confirm
  presence of the `ui-coverage-todo` folder.
- **FR-012**: Invalid due dates MUST block adding the item and display an inline error
  while preserving the user's input for correction.
- **FR-013**: To‚Äëdos are session-only (in-memory); reloading the page resets the list.

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)
- **ToDoItem**: text (string), completed (boolean), dueDate (date | null),
  priority (enum: high | normal), id/index (stable identifier).
- **Filters**: mode (all | due‚Äëtoday | high‚Äëpriority), computed using clock abstraction
  (for due‚Äëtoday) and item priority.
