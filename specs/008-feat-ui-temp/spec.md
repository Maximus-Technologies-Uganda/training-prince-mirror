# Feature Specification: UI — Temperature Converter

**Feature Branch**: `008-feat-ui-temp`  
**Created**: 2025-10-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "feat(ui-temp): Implement the Temperature Converter UI\n\n**Goal:**\nBuild a UI for the temperature converter that allows users to input a value and select units to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit.\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\n- The UI must have an input field for a numeric value.\n- It must have controls (e.g., dropdowns) to select the \"from\" unit and the \"to\" unit (Celsius/Fahrenheit).\n- The UI must display the rounded result (1-2 decimal places).\n- All conversion logic must be reused from the existing backend `temp-converter` core module. No business logic should be duplicated.\n- The UI must handle and display clear error states for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values) and invalid operations (e.g., converting a unit to itself).\n\n**Testing Requirements:**\n- **Vitest (Unit Tests):** Tests must cover successful conversions (C→F, F→C), the identical-units error case, and the non-numeric input error case.\n- **Playwright (E2E Smoke Test):** A smoke test must verify that the page loads correctly and that it successfully converts a sample value.\n\n**Definition of Done:**\n- A pull request is submitted that links to the `/.specify/ui-temp.spec.md` file.\n- The `review-packet` is green, and the UI statement coverage for the Temp module is ≥40%."

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to enter a temperature value, select source and target units (Celsius or Fahrenheit), and see the converted result so that I can quickly convert between units with clear feedback for errors.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the page is loaded, When I enter 0 and choose from "Celsius" to "Fahrenheit", Then I see the result 32 (rounded to 1–2 decimals).
2. Given the page is loaded, When I enter 32 and choose from "Fahrenheit" to "Celsius", Then I see the result 0 (rounded to 1–2 decimals).
3. Given the page is loaded, When I select the same unit for both from and to, Then I see a clear error message indicating identical units are not allowed and no conversion result is shown.
4. Given the page is loaded, When I enter a non-numeric value (e.g., "abc"), Then I see a clear error message indicating the value must be numeric and no conversion result is shown.
5. Given a valid value and unit selection, When I click convert (or conversion triggers), Then the displayed result updates immediately and is rounded to 1–2 decimals.

### Edge Cases
- Very large or very small numeric values should still return a converted result without UI breakage.
- Leading/trailing whitespace around the value should be ignored.
- If inputs are cleared, the result area should reset to an empty/default state.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The UI MUST provide a numeric value input.
- **FR-002**: The UI MUST provide controls to select the from-unit and to-unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
- **FR-003**: The UI MUST display the converted result rounded to 1–2 decimal places.
- **FR-004**: The UI MUST reuse conversion logic from the existing temperature converter core; no business logic is duplicated in the UI.
- **FR-005**: The UI MUST display clear error messages for non-numeric inputs and identical-unit conversions, and suppress the result when errors are present.
- **FR-006**: The UI MUST update the result reactively when the input value or unit selections change.

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)
- **ConversionRequest**: value (number), fromUnit ("C" | "F"), toUnit ("C" | "F").
- **ConversionResult**: value (number, rounded to 1–2 dp), error (optional string when invalid input/identical units).
