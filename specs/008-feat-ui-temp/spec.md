# Feature Specification: UI — Temperature Converter

**Feature Branch**: `008-feat-ui-temp`  
**Created**: 2025-10-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "feat(ui-temp): Implement the Temperature Converter UI\n\n**Goal:**\nBuild a UI for the temperature converter that allows users to input a value and select units to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit.\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\n- The UI must have an input field for a numeric value.\n- It must have controls (e.g., dropdowns) to select the \"from\" unit and the \"to\" unit (Celsius/Fahrenheit).\n- The UI must display the rounded result (1-2 decimal places).\n- All conversion logic must be reused from the existing backend `temp-converter` core module. No business logic should be duplicated.\n- The UI must handle and display clear error states for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values) and invalid operations (e.g., converting a unit to itself).\n\n**Testing Requirements:**\n- **Vitest (Unit Tests):** Tests must cover successful conversions (C→F, F→C), the identical-units error case, and the non-numeric input error case.\n- **Playwright (E2E Smoke Test):** A smoke test must verify that the page loads correctly and that it successfully converts a sample value.\n\n**Definition of Done:**
- A pull request is submitted that links to the `/.specify/ui-temp.spec.md` file.
- The `review-packet` is green, and the UI statement coverage for the Temp module is ≥40%."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-13
- Q: How should conversion be triggered? → A: Auto-convert on any input/unit change
- Q: How should errors be presented? → A: Inline + aria-live assertive; result cleared
- Q: What rounding/display rule should the result use? → A: Round to 2 dp, trim trailing zeros
- Q: What should be the default units on first load? → A: From Celsius → To Fahrenheit
- Q: What happens when inputs are cleared? → A: Clear result and errors; neutral state

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to enter a temperature value, select source and target units (Celsius or Fahrenheit), and see the converted result so that I can quickly convert between units with clear feedback for errors.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the page is loaded, When I enter 0 and choose from "Celsius" to "Fahrenheit", Then I see the result 32 (rounded to 2 dp; trailing zeros trimmed).
2. Given the page is loaded, When I enter 32 and choose from "Fahrenheit" to "Celsius", Then I see the result 0 (rounded to 2 dp; trailing zeros trimmed).
3. Given the page is loaded, When I select the same unit for both from and to, Then an inline error is shown and announced (aria-live="assertive"); the result area is cleared (no value).
4. Given the page is loaded, When I enter a non-numeric value (e.g., "abc"), Then an inline error is shown and announced (aria-live="assertive"); the result area is cleared (no value).
5. Given a valid value and unit selection, When I change the value or either unit, Then the displayed result updates immediately (auto-convert) and is rounded to 1–2 decimals.
6. Given the page is loaded, Then the default units are From "Celsius" and To "Fahrenheit".
7. Given inputs are cleared, Then any prior errors are cleared and the result area is empty (neutral state).

### Edge Cases
- Very large or very small numeric values should still return a converted result without UI breakage.
- Leading/trailing whitespace around the value should be ignored.
- If inputs are cleared, the result area should reset to an empty/default state.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The UI MUST provide a numeric value input.
- **FR-002**: The UI MUST provide controls to select the from-unit and to-unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
- **FR-003**: The UI MUST display the converted result rounded to 2 decimal places and trim trailing zeros when displayed.
- **FR-004**: The UI MUST reuse conversion logic from the existing temperature converter core; no business logic is duplicated in the UI.
- **FR-005**: The UI MUST display inline error messages announced via aria-live="assertive" for non-numeric inputs and identical-unit conversions; the result area is cleared while errors are present.
- **FR-006**: The UI MUST auto-convert on change (value or unit) with no explicit convert button; the result updates reactively when inputs change.
- **FR-007**: On first load, defaults MUST be From "Celsius" and To "Fahrenheit".
- **FR-008**: When inputs are cleared, the UI MUST clear any errors and display no result (neutral state).

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)
- **ConversionRequest**: value (number), fromUnit ("C" | "F"), toUnit ("C" | "F").
- **ConversionResult**: value (number, rounded to 2 dp; UI display trims trailing zeros), error (optional string when invalid input/identical units).
