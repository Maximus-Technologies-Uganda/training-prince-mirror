## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-22
- Q: What are the valid priority levels for to-do items? → A: Three fixed levels: High, Medium, Low
- Q: How are expense categories defined? → A: Fixed system categories from existing Expense UI (Food, Transport, etc.)
- Q: Should filters persist across user sessions? → A: No; filters reset on page close (in-memory, session-only)
- Q: Should empty state messages include icon and CTA? → A: Yes; text + icon + CTA button required
- Q: What is the acceptable latency for filter updates? → A: Very fast (< 300ms)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**Expense Filtering**: A user wants to quickly find specific expenses without scrolling through a long list. They can filter their expense records by category (e.g., "Food", "Transport", "Entertainment") and month to narrow down their search and view only relevant transactions.

**Empty State - Expense**: After applying filters or when they've just started using the app, the user sees a clear, friendly message indicating there are no expenses to display, making it obvious what to do next (add an expense or adjust filters).

**To-Do Filtering**: A user manages multiple tasks with varying priorities and statuses. They want to view their to-do list in different ways—seeing all tasks, only pending tasks, only completed tasks, or filtering by priority level. This helps them focus on what's important right now.

**Empty State - To-Do**: When there are no to-do items matching their filter criteria or when the list is empty, the user sees a clear, helpful empty state message that explains why the list is empty and suggests next steps.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Expense Filtering
1. **Given** a user has multiple expenses recorded in different categories and months, **When** they select a category filter, **Then** the expense list displays only expenses from that category
2. **Given** a user has expenses from multiple months, **When** they select a specific month filter, **Then** the expense list displays only expenses from that month
3. **Given** a user has multiple expenses, **When** they apply both category AND month filters simultaneously, **Then** the expense list displays only expenses matching both criteria
4. **Given** a user has applied filters that result in no matching expenses, **When** they view the list, **Then** they see a clear empty state message

#### To-Do Filtering
1. **Given** a user has to-do items with mixed statuses (pending and completed), **When** they select the "pending" status filter, **Then** the list displays only pending tasks
2. **Given** a user has to-do items with mixed statuses, **When** they select the "completed" status filter, **Then** the list displays only completed tasks
3. **Given** a user has to-do items with different priority levels, **When** they select a priority filter, **Then** the list displays only tasks matching that priority
4. **Given** a user has applied filters that result in no matching items, **When** they view the list, **Then** they see a clear empty state message
5. **Given** a user has no to-do items at all, **When** they view the to-do list, **Then** they see an empty state message that prompts them to create their first task

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user applies filters that result in zero matches? (Answer: Display empty state)
- What happens when a user clears all filters? (Answer: Return to viewing all items)
- What happens if a user adds an expense/to-do while viewing a filtered list? (Answer: System updates accordingly)
- How does the system handle rapid filter changes? (Answer: Filters should respond smoothly without lag)
- What happens when the page is closed/refreshed? (Answer: Filter state resets; user returns to unfiltered view)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Expense UI Filtering
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a category dropdown filter in the Expense UI that displays all categories present in the existing expense system
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a month selector (date picker or dropdown) in the Expense UI that allows users to filter by specific month and year
- **FR-003**: System MUST apply multiple filters simultaneously (category AND month) when both are selected
- **FR-004**: System MUST update the expense list in real-time when any filter is applied or changed, with latency under 300ms
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a "clear filters" or "reset" button to return to the unfiltered view

#### Expense UI Empty State
- **FR-006**: System MUST display a clear, friendly empty state message with accompanying icon when no expenses match the applied filters
- **FR-007**: System MUST display a clear, helpful empty state message with accompanying icon when the expense list is completely empty (no expenses have been added)
- **FR-008**: System MUST include actionable guidance with a CTA button in the empty state (e.g., "Add Your First Expense" button or "Adjust Filters" button as appropriate)

#### To-Do UI Filtering
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide status filter controls that allow users to view "All", "Pending", and "Completed" tasks
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide a priority filter (as a dropdown or multi-select) that allows users to filter by the three priority levels: High, Medium, and Low
- **FR-011**: System MUST apply multiple filters simultaneously (status AND priority) when both are selected
- **FR-012**: System MUST update the to-do list in real-time when any filter is applied or changed, with latency under 300ms
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide a way to clear or reset all active filters

#### To-Do UI Empty State
- **FR-014**: System MUST display a clear, friendly empty state message with accompanying icon when no to-do items match the applied filters
- **FR-015**: System MUST display a clear, helpful empty state message with accompanying icon when the to-do list is completely empty
- **FR-016**: System MUST include actionable guidance with a CTA button in the empty state (e.g., "Create Your First Task" button or "Adjust Filters" button as appropriate)

#### Testing & Documentation
- **FR-017**: System MUST include comprehensive Vitest unit tests for all filtering logic in both Expense and To-Do modules
- **FR-018**: System MUST include Playwright smoke tests that verify UI updates correctly when filters are applied
- **FR-019**: System MUST achieve ≥50% code coverage for UI-expense and UI-todo modules with new tests
- **FR-020**: System MUST include clear "How to test" documentation in the pull request describing test procedures for filters and empty states

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- **NFR-001**: Filter updates must display on-screen within 300ms of user action (measured from filter selection to list re-render completion)
- **NFR-002**: System must handle rapid sequential filter changes without noticeable performance degradation

#### User Experience
- **NFR-003**: Empty states must be visually distinct and encourage user action via prominent CTA buttons
- **NFR-004**: Filter controls must be clearly labeled and intuitive for first-time users

### Key Entities

- **Expense**: Represents a recorded financial transaction with attributes including category (from existing system: Food, Transport, etc.), amount, date, and description. Filters apply based on category and date (month/year).

- **To-Do Item**: Represents a task to be completed with attributes including title, description, status (pending/completed), and priority level (High, Medium, Low). Filters apply based on status and priority.

- **Filter State**: Represents the currently applied filters during the user's session (selected category/month for expenses; selected status/priority for to-dos). Filter state is in-memory and resets when the page closes or is refreshed.
