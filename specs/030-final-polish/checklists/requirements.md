## Summary

✅ **SPECIFICATION APPROVED FOR PLANNING**

All quality checks passed. The specification is:
- Clear and unambiguous
- Comprehensive with 5 prioritized user stories (4 P1, 1 P2)
- Testable with well-defined acceptance scenarios
- Technology-agnostic and business-focused
- Ready for planning and implementation

### Key Strengths

1. **Clear prioritization**: Five user stories with appropriate priority levels (P1, P2)
2. **Comprehensive user perspectives**: Covers reviewer, mentor, project manager, version control auditor, and mentor perspectives
3. **Measurable success criteria**: Seven specific, verifiable outcomes (SC-001 through SC-007)
4. **Edge cases identified**: Four relevant edge cases documented with mitigation considerations
5. **Complete functional requirements**: Ten FR statements covering all aspects of CHANGELOG, review-packet, board cleanup, tagging, and demo
6. **Clear dependencies**: Dependencies on Week 5 Day 0-4 features explicitly stated
7. **Practical acceptance scenarios**: Each user story has 4-5 acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format

### Notes

- The specification successfully captures a finalization/documentation feature with both automated and manual components
- User Story 5 (10-minute demo) is particularly well-defined with specific success criteria tied to user interactions
- The review-packet feature is comprehensive, including coverage, test reports, API docs, and CHANGELOG integration
- CHANGELOG requirements are clear about Week 5 features to document (API Scaffolding, POST /expenses, GET /expenses/summary, Rate Limiter, Coverage Hardening)
