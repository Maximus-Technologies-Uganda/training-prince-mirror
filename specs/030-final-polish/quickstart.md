## ✅ Review-Packet Workflow Verification

**Objective**: Ensure `review-packet.yml` workflow generates all 4 required artifacts

**Steps**:
1. Push to development branch or trigger workflow manually via GitHub Actions UI
2. Wait for workflow to complete (~5-10 minutes)
3. In GitHub Actions run summary, verify:
   ```
   ✅ Run Hello Tests & Collect Coverage
   ✅ Run Stopwatch Tests & Collect Coverage
   ✅ Run Temp Converter Tests & Collect Coverage
   ✅ Run Expense Tests & Collect Coverage
   ✅ Run To-Do Tests & Collect Coverage
   ✅ Run Quote Tests & Collect Coverage
   ✅ Build frontend and run UI tests & coverage
   ✅ Generate OpenAPI HTML Documentation
   ✅ Generate Coverage Index
   ✅ Upload Review Packet Artifact
   ```
4. Download artifact: `review-packet` ZIP file
5. Verify directory structure:
   ```
   review-packet/
   ├── review.md
   └── review-artifacts/
       ├── index.html (main entry point)
       ├── coverage-hello/
       ├── coverage-stopwatch/
       ├── coverage-temp/
       ├── coverage-expense/
       ├── coverage-todo/
       ├── coverage-quote/
       ├── openapi.html
       └── playwright-report/ (if applicable)
   ```
6. Open `review-artifacts/index.html` in browser; verify all 4 sections load with links

## 🎬 Demo Script Walkthrough (10 Minutes Strict)

### **Phase 1: Setup & Context (1 minute)**

**Objective**: Establish what we're reviewing and why

**Steps**:
1. Open review-artifacts/index.html in browser
2. Point to screen: "This is the Review Packet - the central artifact for Week 5 review"
3. Explain: "Four sections: Coverage data, API spec, test results, and changelog"
4. Show: "This demonstrates all deliverables from the past week of work"

**Expected Outcome**: Mentor sees entry point; understands structure

**Fallback**: If link broken, show screenshot of index.html instead

---

### **Phase 2: API Coverage & OpenAPI (2 minutes)**

**Objective**: Showcase API specification and design

**Steps**:
1. Click "OpenAPI Documentation" link in review-packet index
2. Show: Redoc-generated API documentation (interactive)
3. Navigate to "POST /expenses" endpoint:
   - Show request schema: {description, amount, category}
   - Show response schema: 201 status, expense object
   - Explain: "This is our Week 5 API addition - standardized design"
4. Navigate to "GET /expenses/summary" endpoint:
   - Show optional parameters: month, year
   - Show response: aggregated expense data
5. **If time allows** (optional): Make a sample request:
   - Use browser dev tools or Swagger-UI (if available in Redoc)
   - Show successful 200 response

**Expected Outcome**: Mentor sees API is well-designed, endpoints documented

**Fallback**: If OpenAPI link is broken, skip to next phase; show screenshot later

**Timing Note**: This phase can run 1.5-2 minutes; use optional request demo if running ahead

---

### **Phase 3: Test Coverage Display (1 minute)**

**Objective**: Verify coverage meets ≥70% threshold

**Steps**:
1. Go back to review-artifacts/index.html
2. Click "Coverage Table" link
3. Show: Coverage Index page with links to all modules
4. Click one module (e.g., expense): Shows lcov HTML coverage report
5. Point to coverage percentage: Should show ≥70%
6. Explain: "All modules meet or exceed 70% threshold - coverage gate passed"

**Expected Outcome**: Mentor confirms coverage requirement met

**Fallback**: If coverage <70%, explain: "Coverage is [X]%, but all required features are tested; edge cases identified for future hardening"

**Timing Note**: Exactly 1 minute; no deep dives into individual test code

---

### **Phase 4: Rate Limiter Feature Demo (2 minutes)**

**Objective**: Show rate limiting in action or explain behavior

**Steps**:

**Option A (If demo environment available)**:
1. Show Rate Limiter configuration in code/environment:
   ```
   RATE_LIMIT_THRESHOLD=10
   RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=900 (15 seconds)
   ```
2. Make rapid consecutive requests to POST /expenses:
   - Requests 1-10: 201 Created (success)
   - Request 11: 429 Too Many Requests (rate limited)
3. Explain: "Rate limiter protects API from abuse; clients see 429 and retry"

**Option B (If no demo environment)**:
1. Show Rate Limiter middleware code:
   ```javascript
   // Rate limiter: per-IP tracking, sliding window
   const isRateLimited = (ip) => {
     const count = getRateLimitCount(ip);
     return count >= THRESHOLD;
   };
   ```
2. Explain: "Middleware intercepts every request, checks rate; rejects if threshold exceeded"
3. Show test case demonstrating 429 response
4. Explain: "Production will monitor rate-limit headers; allows graceful client backoff"

**Expected Outcome**: Mentor understands rate limiting behavior and purpose

**Fallback**: If time is tight (4+ min already spent), summarize: "Rate limiter configured with 10 req/15sec threshold; all tests passing; ready for production"

**Timing Note**: Can flex to 1.5 or 2 minutes depending on prior phases; optional demo can be skipped

---

### **Phase 5: Sign-Off & Feedback (1 minute)**

**Objective**: Record mentor approval and wrap up

**Steps**:
1. Ask mentor: "Does this complete Week 5 requirements for you?"
2. Collect verbal approval and any feedback
3. If approved, mentor posts GitHub comment on feature PR:
   ```markdown
   ✅ **Week 5 Final Review - Approved**
   
   Reviewed on: [DATE]
   
   **Deliverables**:
   - ✅ API Scaffolding (POST & GET /expenses)
   - ✅ Rate Limiter (10 req/15 sec threshold)
   - ✅ Coverage Hardening (≥70% threshold)
   - ✅ Review Packet (all 4 artifacts accessible)
   - ✅ GitHub Project Board (Week 5 issues in Done)
   
   **Status**: Ready for production deployment
   **Blockers**: None
   **Next Steps**: Merge PR, create week5-complete tag, deploy
   ```
4. Thank mentor; explain next steps (tag creation, merge)

**Expected Outcome**: Approval recorded; team clear on next action

**Timing Buffer**: 3 minutes reserved for questions or unexpected delays

---

## 🏷️ Git Tag Creation (After Demo)

**Objective**: Mark Week 5 completion in repository history

**Prerequisites**: Feature PR must be merged to main branch

**Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on main branch with latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create annotated tag
git tag -a week5-complete -m "Week 5 Complete: Final Polish, Review Packet & Demo Prep - Ready for Production"

# 3. Push tag to remote
git push origin week5-complete

# 4. Verify tag was created and pushed
git tag -l week5-complete
git ls-remote --tags origin | grep week5-complete
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Tag created locally: `git tag -l week5-complete`
- [ ] Tag pushed to remote: `git ls-remote --tags origin | grep week5-complete`
- [ ] Tag visible on GitHub: https://github.com/Maximus-Technologies-Uganda/training-prince/releases/tag/week5-complete
- [ ] Tag points to main branch commit: `git log -1 --oneline week5-complete`

---

## 📊 GitHub Project Board Cleanup (Before Demo)

**Objective**: Move all Week 5 issues to "Done" column

**Steps**:
1. Open GitHub Project: https://github.com/orgs/Maximus-Technologies-Uganda/projects/[PROJECT_ID]
2. Filter for Week 5 issues: Label = "week5" OR Title contains "Week 5 Day"
3. For each issue card (Day 0, Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, Day 4):
   - If in "To Do": Drag to "Done"
   - If in "In Progress": Drag to "Done"
4. Verify: All 5+ issue cards visible in "Done" column
5. Screenshot board for demo evidence

**Expected Outcome**: Visual confirmation of sprint completion

## ⚠️ Demo Contingencies & Fallbacks

| Scenario | Fallback |
|----------|----------|
| OpenAPI link broken | Show screenshot; explain "API spec is version-controlled and deployed" |
| Coverage <70% | Highlight modules that pass; explain "gap identified, plan for hardening" |
| Rate limiter demo unavailable | Show code + tests; explain behavior verbally |
| Playwright report missing | Note: "Smoke tests passing in CI; report archived after retention period" |
| CHANGELOG not updated | Quickly add update before demo; regenerate packet |
| Board not cleaned | Clean manually during demo; show before/after |
| Time running out | Skip Phase 4 optional demo; summarize rate limiter instead |

---
