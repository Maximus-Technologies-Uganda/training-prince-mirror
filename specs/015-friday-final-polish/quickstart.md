## Quickstart: Friday Final Polish Validation

This quickstart outlines the complete validation workflow to verify the Friday Final Polish feature is complete and correct.

---

## Pre-Validation Checklist

Before starting visual review, ensure the development environment is clean and all dependencies are up to date:

```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes from develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start development server
npm run dev
```

Expected output: 
- All dependencies installed successfully
- Development server running on http://localhost:5173

---

## Phase 1: Frontend Build & Test Infrastructure

**Objective**: Verify all build and test infrastructure passes before starting visual polish.

### Step 1.1: Run Full Test Suite

```bash
# Run unit tests with coverage
npm test
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ All unit tests pass
- ✅ Coverage output shows ≥40% statement coverage for each UI app:
  - ui-quote: ≥40%
  - ui-temp: ≥40%
  - ui-expense: ≥40%
  - ui-todo: ≥40%
  - ui-stopwatch: ≥40%
- ℹ️ Document coverage baseline for comparison in final validation

### Step 1.2: Run E2E Test Suite

```bash
# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ All e2e tests pass
- ✅ No visual regression warnings
- ℹ️ Test output shows passing smoke tests for all five UIs

### Step 1.3: Run Linter & Formatter

```bash
# Run ESLint for code quality
npm run lint

# Run Prettier for code formatting (check only)
npm run prettier --check
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ No ESLint errors or warnings
- ✅ All code is properly formatted
- ℹ️ Note: If formatting issues found, run `npm run prettier --write` to fix

### Step 1.4: Build Frontend for Production

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ Output is generated in `frontend/dist/`
- ✅ Build output is <1MB (or within project baseline)
- ℹ️ Check browser console: no warnings or errors in dev tools

---

## Phase 2: Visual Review (Per-Application)

**Objective**: Conduct systematic visual review of each UI application.

For each of the five UIs, perform the following checks:

### Quote UI Visual Review

**URL**: http://localhost:5173/quote

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Layout alignment: All elements aligned to grid (left, center, right)
- [ ] Spacing consistency: Margins and padding match design tokens
- [ ] Typography: Font sizes and weights match design spec
- [ ] Colors: All colors match design token values
- [ ] Button states: Hover, active, disabled states render correctly
- [ ] Form inputs: All inputs properly spaced and aligned
- [ ] Responsive (320px): All content visible, no overlapping
- [ ] Responsive (768px): Layout adapts smoothly

---

## Phase 3: Component Inventory Audit

**Objective**: Document all reusable UI components.

### Step 3.1: Scan Component Library

Inspect `frontend/src/components/` for shared components:

```bash
ls -la frontend/src/components/
```

**For each file**, document:
- Component name
- Type (button, input, card, modal, list, etc.)
- File location
- Applications using it
- CSS classes/variables used
- Example usage

### Step 3.2: Create Component Inventory

**Output**: List of 15-25 components organized by type

**Format**:
```markdown
## UI Component Library

### Buttons
- **PrimaryButton**
  - File: `frontend/src/components/buttons.js`
  - Used in: Quote, Temp, Expense, To-Do, Stopwatch
  - CSS Classes: `btn btn-primary`
  - Example: `<button class="btn btn-primary">Click</button>`

### Inputs
- **FormInput**
  - File: `frontend/src/components/inputs.js`
  - Used in: Quote, Temp, Expense, To-Do
  - CSS Classes: `form-input`
  - Example: `<input class="form-input" type="text">`

### ... (more components)
```

## Phase 4: Design Token Extraction

**Objective**: Extract and verify design tokens from Figma.

### Step 4.1: Access Figma Design Library

1. Open Figma workspace (check team credentials)
2. Navigate to Design Library / Design Tokens file
3. Identify token categories: colors, spacing, typography, shadows, borders

### Step 4.2: Extract Tokens by Category

**Colors Example**:
```json
{
  "color/text/primary": "#333333",
  "color/text/secondary": "#666666",
  "color/background/primary": "#ffffff",
  "color/status/success": "#10b981",
  "color/status/error": "#ef4444"
}
```

**Spacing Example**:
```json
{
  "spacing/xs": "4px",
  "spacing/sm": "8px",
  "spacing/md": "16px",
  "spacing/lg": "24px",
  "spacing/xl": "32px"
}
```

**Typography Example**:
```json
{
  "typography/heading/h1": "32px bold",
  "typography/heading/h2": "24px bold",
  "typography/body": "14px regular",
  "typography/caption": "12px regular"
}
```

### Step 4.3: Verify Code Implementation

For each token, verify code uses matching CSS values:

```bash
# Search for color values
grep -r "#333333" frontend/src/

# Search for CSS variable usage
grep -r "--color-text-primary" frontend/src/
```

**Expected**: Code implementation matches Figma token values

---

## Phase 5: README Documentation

**Objective**: Add component inventory and design tokens to README.

### Step 5.1: Update README with Component Inventory

Add section after project overview:

```markdown
## UI Component Library

All reusable UI components are organized by type. Each component lists the applications using it and links to implementation details.

### Buttons
- [Component list with descriptions]

### Inputs
- [Component list with descriptions]

### Cards
- [Component list with descriptions]

### Modals
- [Component list with descriptions]

### Lists
- [Component list with descriptions]
```

### Step 5.2: Update README with Design Tokens

Add section after components:

```markdown
## Design System Tokens

All design tokens are defined in the Figma design library and implemented in code. This ensures visual consistency across all applications.

### Colors

| Token Name | Value | Usage |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| color/text/primary | #333333 | Primary text |
| color/text/secondary | #666666 | Secondary text |
| ... | ... | ... |

### Spacing

| Token Name | Value | Usage |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| spacing/xs | 4px | Extra small spacing |
| spacing/sm | 8px | Small spacing |
| ... | ... | ... |

### Typography

| Token Name | Value | Usage |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| typography/heading/h1 | 32px bold | Large headings |
| typography/body | 14px regular | Body text |
| ... | ... | ... |

---

**Source of Truth**: All design tokens are defined in the Figma design library and serve as the single source of truth for visual consistency.
```

---

## Phase 6: Final Validation

**Objective**: Run all checks to ensure no regressions and quality gates pass.

### Step 6.1: Run Full Test Suite Again

```bash
npm test
```

**Expected**: Same or improved coverage (no regressions)

### Step 6.2: Run E2E Tests Again

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

**Expected**: All tests pass (no regressions introduced)

### Step 6.3: Verify Linting & Build

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

**Expected**: No errors, build succeeds

### Step 6.4: Check PR Requirements

- [ ] All code changes ≤300 LOC (break into multiple PRs if needed)
- [ ] Spec file included and linked in PR description
- [ ] PR description includes coverage table (before/after)
- [ ] All CI checks pass
- [ ] No test regressions
- [ ] Component inventory added to README
- [ ] Design tokens added to README

---

## Validation Sign-Off

When all phases complete successfully:

✅ Visual review complete (all critical issues fixed)  
✅ Component inventory documented (15-25 components)  
✅ Design tokens extracted and verified (30-50 tokens)  
✅ README updated with both sections  
✅ All tests passing (≥40% coverage per app, 0 regressions)  
✅ Build successful and production-ready  
✅ PR ready for review and merge

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tests fail with coverage below 40%
**Solution**: Review failing tests and add test coverage for components. Do not merge if coverage threshold not met.

### Issue: Visual glitch found after "fixed"
**Solution**: Verify fix in multiple browsers/breakpoints. Test at 320px, 768px, 1920px widths.

### Issue: Token in code doesn't match Figma
**Solution**: Update code to match Figma value (Figma is source of truth). Document the change in commit message.

### Issue: Component not documented in inventory
**Solution**: Check if it's truly reusable (used in ≥2 apps). If yes, add to inventory. If single-use, document rationale.

### Issue: PR exceeds 300 LOC
**Solution**: Split into multiple PRs:
1. PR 1: Visual polish fixes + component tests
2. PR 2: Component inventory documentation
3. PR 3: Design token documentation

---
