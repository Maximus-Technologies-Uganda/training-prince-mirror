# Feature Specification: Friday: Final Polish and Documentation Export

**Feature Branch**: `015-friday-final-polish`  
**Created**: October 28, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Friday: Final Polish and Documentation Export - final tasks for Week 4 focusing on UI polish across all five applications and exporting design system artifacts to README"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Identified: final visual review, component inventory export, token list export
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: developers/designers
   → Actions: conduct visual review, compile inventories, export to documentation
   → Data: UI components, design tokens, color/spacing/typography variables
   → Constraints: no new functionality, polish only; maintain consistency
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Token values format clarified as key:value pairs (e.g., color/text/primary: #333333)
   → Visual polish scope: alignment, spacing, glitches (no major changes)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Visual review workflow for all five UIs
   → Documentation export process
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement is testable and measurable
   → No ambiguities identified
6. Identify Key Entities
   → UI Components, Design Tokens
7. Run Review Checklist
   → No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   → All implementation details marked where present
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT needs to be polished and documented, and WHY
- ✅ Written for team stakeholders and developers
- ✅ Scope: visual refinement + documentation export only

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-28
- Q: What criteria determine whether a UI component qualifies for the component inventory? → A: All reusable components across the five apps, including single-use specialized ones
- Q: What constitutes "passing" the visual review for a UI — is there a quantitative acceptance threshold? → A: Critical issues fixed; minor issues prioritized by severity during implementation
- Q: What is the authoritative source for design tokens — should they be extracted from Figma or codebase? → A: Extract from Figma design library (source of truth); ensure code matches
- Q: How should the component inventory organize or categorize the components in the README? → A: Organize by component type (buttons, inputs, cards, modals, lists, etc.)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer/designer completing Week 4, I need to conduct a final visual review of all five applications (Quote, Temperature Converter, Expense Tracker, To-Do List, Stopwatch) to ensure they have a polished, consistent appearance, and then export the component inventory and design tokens to the project README so the design system is documented and discoverable for future development.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the five UIs are built and deployed, **When** I conduct a visual review, **Then** I identify and fix minor alignment issues, spacing inconsistencies, and visual glitches
2. **Given** I have completed the visual polish, **When** I compile the component inventory, **Then** I document all reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.) used across the applications
3. **Given** the component inventory is complete, **When** I add it to the README, **Then** the component list is visible in a dedicated section with descriptions
4. **Given** the component documentation is added, **When** I compile the design token list, **Then** I document all design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) with their values
5. **Given** the design tokens are compiled, **When** I add them to the README, **Then** token names and values are visible in a dedicated section (e.g., color/text/primary: #333333)
6. **Given** all documentation is updated, **When** I run the test suite, **Then** all CI checks pass and no regressions are introduced

### Edge Cases
- What happens if visual inconsistencies are found during review? → Document and fix them
- How should the component inventory be organized if components are used across multiple applications? → RESOLVED: Organize by component type
- Should the token list be organized alphabetically or by category? → Use logical grouping (colors, spacing, typography) for clarity

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a final visual review checklist covering all five UIs (Quote, Temperature Converter, Expense Tracker, To-Do List, Stopwatch)
- **FR-002**: Developers MUST be able to identify and fix minor alignment issues, spacing inconsistencies, and visual glitches across all five applications, prioritizing critical issues and minor issues by severity
- **FR-003**: System MUST compile a complete inventory of all reusable UI components across the five applications, including both multi-use components and single-use specialized components (e.g., buttons, inputs, cards, modals, lists)
- **FR-004**: Component inventory MUST be exported and documented in a dedicated section within the main README.md file, organized by component type (buttons, inputs, cards, modals, lists, etc.)
- **FR-005**: Component inventory documentation MUST include component name, description, usage examples, and locations across applications for each type grouping
- **FR-006**: System MUST compile a complete list of all design tokens defined in the Figma design library (source of truth: colors, spacing, typography, etc.) and verify code implementation matches
- **FR-007**: Design token list MUST be exported from Figma with token name and corresponding value (e.g., color/text/primary: #333333)
- **FR-008**: Design tokens MUST be exported and documented in a dedicated section within the main README.md file, noting Figma as the authoritative source
- **FR-009**: The specification file MUST be created at `.specify/ui-final-polish.spec.md` to ensure work is spec-driven
- **FR-010**: All unit tests MUST pass (npm test) to ensure no regressions
- **FR-011**: All end-to-end tests MUST pass (npm run test:e2e) to ensure no regressions in user flows
- **FR-012**: A final pull request MUST be submitted including the spec file and README updates
- **FR-013**: The final PR MUST pass all CI checks before merging to the development branch

### Key Entities *(documentation/data involved)*
- **UI Component**: A reusable visual element (button, input field, card, modal, list item, etc.) used across one or more applications
  - Attributes: name, type, description, location(s) in codebase, usage examples
  - Relationships: used in Quote, Temperature Converter, Expense Tracker, To-Do List, and/or Stopwatch applications

- **Design Token**: A named variable representing a design decision (color, spacing value, typography rule, etc.)
  - Attributes: token name (e.g., color/text/primary), value (e.g., #333333), category (color, spacing, typography)
  - Relationships: applied across multiple UI components and applications

- **Visual Polish Issue**: A minor refinement needed during the final review
  - Attributes: issue type (alignment, spacing, glitch), severity (cosmetic), location (application, screen, element)
  - Status: identified, in-progress, resolved, verified
