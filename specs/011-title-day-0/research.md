# Research: CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement and Repository Hygiene

## CI/CD Pipeline Best Practices

### Decision: Unified Coverage Reporting with Partial Failure Handling
**Rationale**: Based on clarification that CI should continue with partial coverage reports plus error indicators when some applications fail. This ensures reviewers always get available information while clearly indicating what failed.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Complete CI failure on any coverage failure (too strict, blocks all reviews)
- Silent failure with no error indication (unclear for reviewers)
- Retry mechanism (adds complexity without clear benefit)

### Decision: Playwright Artifact Upload Failure = Complete CI Failure
**Rationale**: When smoke test artifacts cannot be uploaded, the entire CI pipeline fails. This ensures reviewers have access to failure debugging information or the build is considered invalid.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Continue with partial artifacts (reviewers need complete failure context)
- Local storage with download instructions (complexity overhead)
- Retry upload mechanism (may mask underlying infrastructure issues)

## Repository Hygiene Patterns

### Decision: Dedicated /data/ Directory with Conflict Detection
**Rationale**: Centralized state file management improves organization and prevents accidental commits. Conflict detection ensures data integrity during migration.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Overwrite existing files (risks data loss)
- Backup with timestamp (unnecessary complexity)
- Merge existing files (unclear merge strategy)

### Decision: Comprehensive README Documentation
**Rationale**: Detailed step-by-step guide ensures external reviewers can effectively use the review-packet without project-specific knowledge.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Simple link only (insufficient for external reviewers)
- Automated script (adds maintenance overhead)
- Links to both branches (confusing for reviewers)

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: One Primary User Workflow Per Application
**Rationale**: Focused smoke tests validate core functionality without excessive complexity. Each application gets one representative workflow test.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Complete user journeys (too complex for smoke tests)
- Basic page load only (insufficient functionality validation)
- Multiple workflows per app (exceeds smoke test scope)

## Coverage Reporting Architecture

### Decision: Consolidated Review-Packet Structure
**Rationale**: Single artifact with indexed access to all coverage reports provides efficient reviewer experience while maintaining separation of concerns.

**Structure**:
```
review-artifacts/
├── index.html (central entry point)
├── review.md (enriched metadata)
├── coverage-<app>/ (backend coverage)
└── ui-coverage-<app>/ (frontend coverage)
```

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate artifacts per application (fragmented reviewer experience)
- Single merged report (loses application-specific details)
- Multiple index files (confusing navigation)

## Error Handling Patterns

### Decision: Graceful Degradation for Coverage, Strict Failure for Artifacts
**Rationale**: Coverage failures are informational (partial data still valuable), while artifact upload failures are operational (complete debugging context required).

**Implementation**:
- Coverage failures: Continue with error indicators in review.md
- Artifact failures: Fail entire CI pipeline
- Data migration conflicts: Require manual resolution

## Performance Considerations

### Decision: Optimized CI Pipeline Timing
**Rationale**: Target <10 minutes total CI time with <5 minutes for coverage generation ensures rapid feedback while maintaining comprehensive reporting.

**Optimization strategies**:
- Parallel coverage generation across applications
- Cached dependencies and build artifacts
- Incremental coverage reporting where possible
