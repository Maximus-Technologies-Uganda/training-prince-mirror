# Feature Specification: Day 0: CI Maturity, Review Packet Parity, and Repository Hygiene

**Feature Branch**: `011-title-day-0`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Title: Day 0: CI Maturity, Review Packet Parity, and Repository Hygiene

Context: This specification outlines the necessary \"Finish-to-Green\" tasks required to clear carry-over blockers before starting new Week 4 scope . The goal is to establish a mature, reviewable, and stable baseline for our project. We will enhance our Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, improve repository hygiene, and implement foundational end-to-end (E2E) smoke tests.

Core Requirements:

Review Packet Parity & CI Enhancement :

Unified Coverage Reporting: The CI process must generate and collect both backend and UI test coverage reports for all five applications (quote, expense, temp, todo, stopwatch) . All reports should be consolidated into a single review-artifacts directory .

Coverage Index: Create a central review-artifacts/index.html that serves as a single entry point, linking to both the backend and UI coverage reports for each application .

Enriched review.md: The review.md artifact must be augmented to include environment details (Node/npm versions), a log of the last 20 commits, a two-level repository map, and summary tables for both backend and UI coverage statistics .

Repository Hygiene & Clarity :

State File Management: Relocate all runtime state files (e.g., expenses.json, todo.json, stopwatch-state.json) into a new, dedicated /data/ directory .

Gitignore Update: The /data/ directory must be added to .gitignore to prevent state files from being committed to the repository .

Mirror and README: The default branch on the mirror repository should be set to development . If not possible, the README.md on the main branch must include a \"How to review me\" section with clear instructions for reviewers to find and use the review-packet from the development branch CI runs .

File Cleanup: Remove any stray or temporary files from all branches to ensure a clean repository state .

E2E Smoke Testing with Playwright :

Test Implementation: Create one foundational Playwright smoke test for each of the five UIs, verifying a key piece of functionality (e.g., quote filtering, expense calculation, temperature conversion) .

Failure Artifacts: Configure the CI pipeline to automatically capture and upload Playwright traces and screenshots as artifacts whenever a smoke test fails .

PR Integration: The link to the CI smoke test run must be referenced in the corresponding pull request for easy access and review .

Definition of Done:

A CI run on the mirror repository successfully generates and uploads a single review-packet artifact .

The review-packet contains distinct coverage-<app> and ui-coverage-<app> folders, along with the main Coverage Index index.html .

The review.md file within the artifact is fully enriched as per the requirements .

The repository's README.md is updated with the review instructions, and the default branch is clarified .

The /data/ directory exists and is correctly ignored by Git .

Playwright smoke tests for all five UIs are present and integrated into the CI pipeline ."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27
- Q: What should happen when coverage report generation fails for one or more applications? ‚Üí A: CI pipeline should continue and generate partial review packet with available reports plus error indicators
- Q: What should happen when Playwright test failures occur but artifacts cannot be uploaded? ‚Üí A: CI pipeline should fail completely and not proceed with review packet generation
- Q: What should happen if the /data/ directory already exists with conflicting files? ‚Üí A: Fail migration and require manual resolution of conflicts
- Q: What constitutes "key functionality" for each UI's smoke test? ‚Üí A: One primary user workflow per application (e.g., quote filtering, expense calculation)
- Q: What specific information should be included in the "How to review me" section of README.md? ‚Üí A: Detailed step-by-step guide including prerequisites, access methods, and artifact interpretation

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a project reviewer, I need a comprehensive review packet that consolidates all test coverage reports and repository information so that I can efficiently assess the project's quality and readiness for production deployment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a CI pipeline runs on the development branch, **When** the build completes, **Then** a single review-packet artifact is generated containing unified coverage reports for all five applications
2. **Given** a reviewer accesses the review-artifacts/index.html, **When** they navigate the interface, **Then** they can access both backend and UI coverage reports for each application (quote, expense, temp, todo, stopwatch)
3. **Given** a reviewer opens the review.md file, **When** they read the contents, **Then** they find environment details, commit history, repository structure, and coverage statistics
4. **Given** a developer pushes changes to any branch, **When** Playwright smoke tests run, **Then** failure artifacts (traces and screenshots) are automatically captured and uploaded
5. **Given** a pull request is created, **When** CI runs complete, **Then** the PR includes links to smoke test results for easy reviewer access

### Edge Cases
- When coverage reports fail to generate for one or more applications, the CI pipeline continues and generates a partial review packet with available reports plus clear error indicators for failed applications
- When Playwright test failures occur but artifacts cannot be uploaded, the CI pipeline fails completely and does not proceed with review packet generation
- When the /data/ directory already exists with conflicting files, the migration fails and requires manual resolution of conflicts before proceeding
