# Feature Specification: Day 0 Blockers for Week 3 UI Development

**Feature Branch**: `004-implement-day-0`  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: Ready  
**Input**: User description: "Implement Day 0 Blockers to prepare the repository for Week 3 UI development..."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10
- Q: Should spec-lint fail the PR if any acceptance boxes are unchecked across all `specs/*/spec.md` files? ‚Üí A: Only fail for the active feature‚Äôs spec.
- Q: Confirm the CI artifact and backend app set used for the coverage index. ‚Üí A: Artifact is `review-packet`; apps: hello, stopwatch, temp-converter, expense, todo, quote.
- Q: UI coverage directory naming for future reports: confirm path schema. ‚Üí A: `review-artifacts/ui-coverage-<app>/lcov-report/`.
- Q: Which UI modules are in scope for initial coverage scaffolding in CI? ‚Üí A: quote, expense, temp, todo, stopwatch.
- Q: README ‚ÄúHow to review me‚Äù scope: confirm mention of where to find the artifact. ‚Üí A: Only mention PR runs.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a reviewer and CI operator, I need a clean, consistent repository with standardized artifacts so I can download a single `review-packet`, open `review-artifacts/index.html`, and navigate to per-app backend coverage and scaffolded UI coverage links.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh clone, **When** CI runs, **Then** a single artifact named `review-packet` contains `review-artifacts/coverage-<app>/lcov-report/` for six CLIs and an index page linking to each.
2. **Given** runtime writes, **When** todo/stopwatch/expense save data, **Then** files are created under `/data` and `/data` is git-ignored.
3. **Given** UI tests are added, **When** CI runs, **Then** any UI coverage directories are published under `review-artifacts/ui-coverage-<app>/lcov-report/` and the index shows a "UI Coverage" section.
4. **Given** specs exist, **When** PR is opened, **Then** spec lint fails if acceptance boxes are unchecked.
5. **Given** the README, **When** a reviewer reads it, **Then** it documents how to download `review-packet` and open the index.

### Edge Cases
- Missing UI packages: CI should continue and only include existing UI coverage folders.
- Empty `/data`: Apps should create directories/files on first write without crashing.
- Stray files: Junk like `hello.js..js` should be removed from version control.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: CI MUST upload a single artifact named `review-packet`.
- **FR-002**: Artifact MUST include six backend coverage folders under `review-artifacts/coverage-<app>/lcov-report/` (apps: `hello`, `stopwatch`, `temp-converter`, `expense`, `todo`, `quote`).
- **FR-003**: Index page `review-artifacts/index.html` MUST link to each of the six reports.
- **FR-004**: UI coverage directories MUST be placed at `review-artifacts/ui-coverage-<app>/lcov-report/` when present (UIs in scope: `quote`, `expense`, `temp`, `todo`, `stopwatch`).
- **FR-005**: README MUST include "How to review me" (mention PR runs only) and a placeholder "Frontend" section.
- **FR-006**: Runtime state MUST be stored under `/data` and `/data` MUST be git-ignored.
- **FR-007**: Repo MUST include `/.specify/` directory with UI spec stubs.
- **FR-008**: A `spec:lint` script MUST fail CI when acceptance boxes are unchecked in the active feature‚Äôs spec.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Review Packet**: Single CI artifact containing `review-artifacts/` index and coverage subfolders.
- **Runtime Data**: Files `todo.json`, `stopwatch.json`, `expenses.json` under `/data` created at runtime and ignored by git.
