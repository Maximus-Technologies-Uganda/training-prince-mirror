# Feature Specification: UI Stopwatch

**Feature Branch**: `002-what-build-a`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "What: Build a UI for the stopwatch application with Start, Stop, and Reset buttons, plus an \"Export CSV\" feature for lap data. The UI must use the existing core logic. Why: To provide a simple graphical interface for timing events and exporting lap data. Acceptance: - Vitest tests for CSV output (golden file and empty state). - Playwright smoke test for start/stop functionality. - ‚â•40% statement coverage for the ui-stopwatch module."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to control a stopwatch with clear Start, Stop, and Reset actions and export captured lap data to CSV so I can time activities and share results easily.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the stopwatch is reset and idle, When I press Start, Then elapsed time begins increasing and the UI indicates running state.
2. Given the stopwatch is running, When I press Stop, Then elapsed time stops increasing and the UI indicates stopped state.
3. Given the stopwatch is running or stopped with recorded laps, When I press Reset, Then elapsed time returns to 00:00.000 and laps are cleared.
4. Given there are recorded laps, When I export to CSV, Then I receive a CSV file whose contents match the defined format (golden test).
5. Given there are no laps recorded, When I export to CSV, Then I receive a valid CSV with headers and no data rows (empty-state test).
6. Given the stopwatch is running, When I open the app and run the Playwright smoke, Then it can Start and Stop without error and UI reflects the state.

### Edge Cases
- Rapid successive Start/Stop clicks do not create invalid states; only one running instance is possible at a time.
- Reset while running behaves predictably: resets elapsed time and laps, leaving the stopwatch in an idle state.
- CSV export handles special characters in lap labels (if present) using proper CSV escaping.
- Export is available even when there are no laps (produces headers only), and is disabled if the UI cannot access lap data.
- Time formatting is consistent and stable (e.g., mm:ss.mmm) across the UI and CSV output.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Users MUST be able to Start, Stop, and Reset the stopwatch via clear UI controls.
- **FR-002**: Users MUST be able to record and view laps in a list with stable ordering.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to export laps as a CSV file using the existing exporter behavior.
- **FR-004**: The UI MUST reflect running vs stopped states clearly and update elapsed time while running.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST prevent invalid concurrent states (e.g., multiple timers running simultaneously).
- **FR-006**: The UI MUST reuse existing core logic from `src/stopwatch/` for timing and from `src/stopwatch/exporter.js` for CSV generation without duplicating domain logic.
- **FR-007**: Vitest MUST include tests for CSV output: golden-file match (non-empty) and empty-state CSV.
- **FR-008**: A Playwright smoke MUST start and then stop the stopwatch successfully in a running build.
- **FR-009**: The `ui-stopwatch` module MUST achieve ‚â•40% statement coverage measured by Vitest; coverage MUST be included in the CI review packet.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **StopwatchState**: running (boolean), startTimestamp (instant | null), elapsedMs (number), laps (Lap[])
- **Lap**: ordinal (number), lapDurationMs (number), cumulativeMs (number), label (string | null)
