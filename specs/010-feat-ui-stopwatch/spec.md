# Feature Specification: Stopwatch UI Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `010-feat-ui-stopwatch`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "feat(ui-stopwatch): Implement the Stopwatch UI"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27
- Q: How are laps recorded? ‚Üí A: Laps are automatically recorded when user clicks stop (each stop creates a lap)
- Q: Timer display format? ‚Üí A: MM:SS with hundredths
- Q: CSV file structure? ‚Üí A: Two columns: lap number, elapsed time
- Q: Button state behavior? ‚Üí A: Buttons disabled/enabled based on timer state
- Q: CSV file naming? ‚Üí A: stopwatch-laps.csv

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to interact with a stopwatch interface that allows me to start, stop, and reset a timer, and export my recorded lap data as a CSV file, so that I can track time intervals and analyze my timing data.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the stopwatch UI is loaded, **When** I click the start button, **Then** the timer begins counting elapsed time
2. **Given** the stopwatch is running, **When** I click the stop button, **Then** the timer stops and displays the final elapsed time
3. **Given** the stopwatch is stopped, **When** I click the reset button, **Then** the timer resets to zero and clears any recorded data
4. **Given** I have recorded lap data, **When** I click the export button, **Then** a CSV file is downloaded with normalized line endings containing the lap data
5. **Given** I have no recorded lap data, **When** I click the export button, **Then** a CSV file is downloaded with only headers

### Edge Cases
- Start button is disabled when timer is already running
- Stop button is disabled when timer is already stopped
- Export button remains enabled but generates CSV with headers only when no laps recorded
- Reset button remains enabled and can be clicked while timer is running (stops timer and clears data)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a start button that initiates timer counting
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a stop button that halts timer counting and displays elapsed time
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a reset button that returns timer to zero and clears lap data
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide an export button that generates a downloadable CSV file named "stopwatch-laps.csv"
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate CSV files with normalized line endings (EOL) for test stability
- **FR-006**: System MUST reuse all business logic from the existing backend stopwatch core module
- **FR-007**: System MUST display elapsed time in MM:SS with hundredths format on the UI
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle empty state export (CSV with headers only)
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate CSV export against golden output for testing

### Key Entities
- **Timer**: Represents the stopwatch state (running, stopped, elapsed time)
- **Lap Data**: Represents recorded time intervals automatically created when user clicks stop
- **CSV Export**: Represents the downloadable file containing lap number and elapsed time columns with normalized formatting
