# Quickstart: Stopwatch UI

**Feature**: Stopwatch UI Implementation  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Phase**: 1 - Design & Contracts

## User Story Validation

### Primary User Story
> As a user, I want to interact with a stopwatch interface that allows me to start, stop, and reset a timer, and export my recorded lap data as a CSV file, so that I can track time intervals and analyze my timing data.

## Quickstart Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Timer Operation
**Given**: Stopwatch UI is loaded  
**When**: User clicks the start button  
**Then**: 
- Timer begins counting elapsed time
- Display shows increasing time in MM:SS.hh format
- Start button becomes disabled
- Stop button becomes enabled

**When**: User clicks the stop button  
**Then**:
- Timer stops and displays final elapsed time
- Lap is automatically recorded
- Start button becomes enabled
- Stop button becomes disabled

### Scenario 2: Lap Recording
**Given**: Timer is running  
**When**: User clicks stop  
**Then**: 
- Lap is recorded with lap number and elapsed time
- Lap appears in laps display
- Timer stops

**When**: User clicks start again  
**Then**:
- Timer resumes from zero
- Previous laps remain visible

### Scenario 3: Reset Functionality
**Given**: Timer has recorded laps  
**When**: User clicks reset  
**Then**:
- Timer resets to 00:00.00
- All recorded laps are cleared
- Laps display is empty
- All buttons return to initial state

### Scenario 4: CSV Export with Data
**Given**: Timer has recorded laps  
**When**: User clicks export button  
**Then**:
- CSV file "stopwatch-laps.csv" is downloaded
- File contains headers: "Lap Number,Elapsed Time"
- File contains lap data with MM:SS.hh format
- File has normalized line endings

### Scenario 5: CSV Export Empty State
**Given**: Timer has no recorded laps  
**When**: User clicks export button  
**Then**:
- CSV file "stopwatch-laps.csv" is downloaded
- File contains only headers: "Lap Number,Elapsed Time"
- File has normalized line endings

### Scenario 6: Button State Management
**Given**: Timer is stopped  
**When**: User clicks start button  
**Then**: Start button becomes disabled, stop button enabled

**Given**: Timer is running  
**When**: User clicks stop button  
**Then**: Stop button becomes disabled, start button enabled

**Given**: Timer is running  
**When**: User clicks reset button  
**Then**: Timer stops, resets, all buttons return to initial state

## Integration Test Steps

### Step 1: Load UI
1. Navigate to `/frontend/src/ui-stopwatch/index.html`
2. Verify page loads without errors
3. Verify timer display shows "00:00.00"
4. Verify all buttons are in correct initial state

### Step 2: Timer Operation
1. Click start button
2. Verify timer begins counting
3. Wait 2-3 seconds
4. Click stop button
5. Verify timer stops and lap is recorded
6. Verify button states update correctly

### Step 3: Multiple Laps
1. Click start button
2. Wait 1 second, click stop
3. Click start button
4. Wait 2 seconds, click stop
5. Verify two laps are recorded
6. Verify lap numbers are sequential

### Step 4: Reset
1. Click reset button
2. Verify timer resets to "00:00.00"
3. Verify all laps are cleared
4. Verify button states reset

### Step 5: CSV Export
1. Record 2-3 laps
2. Click export button
3. Verify CSV file downloads
4. Open CSV file and verify format
5. Verify normalized line endings

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ Start button initiates timer counting
- ✅ Stop button halts timer and displays elapsed time
- ✅ Reset button returns timer to zero and clears laps
- ✅ Export button generates downloadable CSV file
- ✅ CSV files have normalized line endings
- ✅ Backend logic is reused (no duplication)
- ✅ Timer displays in MM:SS.hh format
- ✅ Empty state export works correctly

### Non-Functional Requirements
- ✅ UI responds within 200ms
- ✅ Timer updates at 60fps
- ✅ Coverage ≥40% (measured by Vitest)
- ✅ Smoke test passes (Playwright)

### Edge Cases
- ✅ Start button disabled when running
- ✅ Stop button disabled when stopped
- ✅ Export works with no laps
- ✅ Reset works while running
