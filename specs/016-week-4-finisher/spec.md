# Feature Specification: Week 4 Finisher: Configure and Enforce Coverage Thresholds

**Feature Branch**: `016-week-4-finisher`  
**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Week 4 Finisher: Configure and Enforce Coverage Thresholds..."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team lead, I need to ensure our test suite meets quality standards by enforcing minimum code coverage thresholds. This helps maintain code quality and prevents regressions as the codebase grows, while ensuring the coverage metrics accurately represent the tested application code (excluding build artifacts, test files, and review materials).

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the development team pushes code to the repository, **When** CI runs the test suite, **Then** the build fails if coverage falls below the configured thresholds (60% statements, 60% lines, 60% functions, 50% branches)
2. **Given** developers run tests locally with coverage enabled, **When** coverage is calculated, **Then** excluded directories (review-artifacts, build outputs, node_modules, test files) are not counted in the coverage metrics
3. **Given** the test suite includes UI components from frontend/src/ui-*, **When** coverage is calculated, **Then** these UI files are correctly included in the coverage collection process
4. **Given** the CI pipeline is configured, **When** tests run with coverage enabled, **Then** the coverage report reflects only application code that should be tested
5. **Given** a pull request is submitted with coverage below thresholds, **When** CI runs, **Then** the build fails and prevents merge until coverage is restored

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a file matches multiple exclude patterns? (Should be excluded)
- How does the system handle new directories added to the codebase? (Thresholds should continue to apply)
- What if developers commit code that temporarily brings coverage below the threshold? (CI should fail and block the merge)

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-29
- Q: When coverage dips below thresholds, what should happen? → A: Hard block - prevent all merges (CI fails)
- Q: Should coverage thresholds apply globally or per-module? → A: Global only - 60/50/60/60 enforced uniformly
- Q: Where should coverage reports be stored and made accessible? → A: Integrated into review-packet artifact for historical tracking
- Q: Can coverage thresholds be updated, and who can approve changes? → A: Fixed thresholds - changes require spec amendment and team consensus

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST enforce global coverage thresholds uniformly across the entire codebase: 60% for statements, 60% for lines, 60% for functions, and 50% for branches
- **FR-002**: System MUST exclude the `**/review-artifacts/**` directory from coverage calculations
- **FR-003**: System MUST exclude build output directories (dist/, build/, etc.) from coverage calculations
- **FR-004**: System MUST exclude test files themselves (*.test.js, *.spec.ts, *.spec.js) from coverage calculations
- **FR-005**: System MUST exclude node_modules and coverage configuration files from coverage calculations
- **FR-006**: System MUST include all UI source files from frontend/src/ui-* directories in the coverage collection process
- **FR-007**: CI pipeline MUST run tests with coverage enabled and configured to fail if coverage thresholds are not met, preventing merge of pull requests
- **FR-008**: The Vitest configuration file MUST contain the specified threshold values and exclusion patterns
- **FR-009**: Coverage reports MUST be generated and integrated into the review-packet artifact for historical tracking and retrospective analysis
- **FR-010**: Developers MUST be able to run tests locally with the same coverage configuration and thresholds that are enforced in CI
- **FR-011**: Coverage thresholds (60/50/60/60) are fixed and locked; any changes to thresholds require specification amendment and team consensus approval

### Non-Functional Quality Attributes
- **CI Enforcement**: Coverage check failures MUST block all merges to development and main branches with hard failure (no override mechanism)
- **Threshold Governance**: Coverage thresholds remain fixed at 60/50/60/60; adjustments require formal spec amendment and team approval
- **Reporting**: Coverage reports MUST be persisted in the review-packet artifact as the source of truth for coverage metrics across all builds
- **Consistency**: Coverage thresholds apply uniformly to all code; no per-module or branch-specific variations are permitted

### Key Entities
- **Coverage Threshold Configuration**: Defines minimum acceptable percentages (60% statements, 60% lines, 60% functions, 50% branches) applied globally and uniformly
- **Exclusion Patterns**: Specifies which files and directories should be excluded from coverage calculation (review-artifacts, build outputs, test files, node_modules)
- **CI Workflow**: The automated pipeline that enforces coverage thresholds and fails builds/blocks merges when thresholds are not met
- **Coverage Report**: The artifact generated by tests, integrated into review-packet, measuring code coverage against included application code with hard enforcement in CI
- **Threshold Governance Record**: Specification version tracking for any future threshold adjustments (requires amendment and team consensus)
