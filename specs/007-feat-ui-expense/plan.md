# Implementation Plan: UI — Expense

**Branch**: `007-feat-ui-expense` | **Date**: 2025-10-13 | **Spec**: `/Users/prnceb/Desktop/WORK/hello-world/specs/007-feat-ui-expense/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/007-feat-ui-expense/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the constitution document
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
6. Execute Phase 1 → data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/
7. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
Build an Expense UI that lists expenses, supports filtering by month (1–12) and by category (dropdown derived from data), and shows a total for the filtered results. Reuse backend core logic from `src/expense/core.js`. Provide unit tests (table‑driven filter combinations) and a Playwright smoke test (totals area visible).

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript (ESM), Node 20  
**Primary Dependencies**: Vite (frontend), Vitest + @vitest/coverage-v8, Playwright  
**Storage**: File JSON via `data/expenses.json` (through `src/expense/core.js`)  
**Testing**: Vitest (unit, coverage), Playwright (smoke)  
**Target Platform**: Web (Vite dev server / static build)  
**Project Type**: web  
**Performance Goals**: N/A for Day 2 scope  
**Constraints**: No logic duplication; UI coverage ≥40%; Single review‑packet artifact  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-page UI, small data set

## Constitution Check
Gates from Constitution v1.1.0:
- No Logic Duplication → Plan imports `src/expense/core.js` directly (PASS)
- Test Coverage Mandate (≥40% UI statements + smoke) → Enforced via `frontend/vitest.config.js` (PASS)
- Reviewability/Review‑packet → Existing workflow generates indexed reports (PASS)
- PR Craft (≤300 LOC, coverage table, spec link) → Will enforce during PR (PASS)

**Structure Decision**: Web application; implement `frontend/src/ui-expense/` to reuse backend core and expose UI with filters + table + total.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
Decisions (from clarifications):
- Month input is numeric 1–12; normalize via `String(month).padStart(2, '0')` for core interop.
- Category is a dropdown of known categories derived from existing expense data (unique, sorted), includes “All”.
- Empty state: show “No expenses found” and total 0.
- Table columns: Date, Category, Amount (Date can present month mapping or date if present in data).

Output: `/Users/prnceb/Desktop/WORK/hello-world/specs/007-feat-ui-expense/research.md`

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
Data model (see `data-model.md`):
- ExpenseItem { month: 1–12, category: string, amount: number }

Contracts:
- No external API endpoints; UI reads data via existing core library. Create `contracts/README.md` noting “No external contracts”.

Quickstart:
- Run unit tests and smoke test; instructions provided in `quickstart.md`.

Output: data‑model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/README.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
The `/tasks` command will generate tasks from the artifacts above; tests first (table‑driven), then implement UI wiring and views, then e2e smoke.

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
Out of scope for `/plan`.

# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

```

**Structure Decision**: [Document the selected structure and reference the real
directories captured above]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
