# Feature Specification: UI ‚Äî Expense

**Feature Branch**: `007-feat-ui-expense`  
**Created**: 2025-10-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "feat(ui-expense): Implement the Expense UI\n\nGoal: Build a UI for managing expenses based on the Day 2 requirements. The UI will allow users to view a list of their expenses, filter them by month and category, and see a total amount for the filtered results.\n\nFunctional Requirements:\n- The UI must have input fields to filter by month and category.\n- It must display a table of filtered expenses and a calculated total amount.\n- All business logic must be imported and reused from the existing backend expense core module. There should be no duplication of logic in the frontend.\n\nTesting Requirements:\n- Vitest (Unit Tests): Tests must be table-driven to cover all filter combinations: month only, category only, both filters applied, and no filters applied.\n- Playwright (E2E Smoke Test): A smoke test must verify that the page loads correctly and that the totals area is visible on the page.\n\nDefinition of Done:\n- A pull request is submitted that links to the /.specify/ui-expense.spec.md file.\n- The review-packet is green, and the UI statement coverage for the Expense module is ‚â•40%."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
2. Extract key concepts: filters (month, category), table display, total calculation, reuse of expense core, tests
3. Ambiguities: none critical for Day 2 scope
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing
5. Generate Functional Requirements (testable)
6. Identify Key Entities (Expense item)
7. Run Review Checklist
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- Mandatory sections: completed below

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a user, I can filter my expenses by month and/or category and see the matching items with a running total so that I understand my spending.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the page is open, When no filters are applied, Then all expenses are listed and the total reflects all items.
2. Given a month is selected, When category is empty, Then only expenses from that month are listed and the total reflects those items.
3. Given a category is selected, When month is empty, Then only expenses matching that category are listed and the total reflects those items.
4. Given both month and category are selected, When filters are applied, Then only matching expenses are listed and the total reflects only those items.

### Edge Cases
- No expenses match the filters ‚Üí show an empty table state and total 0.
- Invalid filter values (not parsable) ‚Üí ignore and treat as no filter selected.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-13
- Q: How should ‚Äúmonth‚Äù be input? ‚Üí A: Numeric 1‚Äì12.
- Q: Category input style? ‚Üí A: Dropdown of known categories.
- Q: Source of ‚Äúknown categories‚Äù? ‚Üí A: Derived from existing expense data.
- Q: Empty-state behavior when filters match 0 items? ‚Üí A: Show ‚ÄúNo expenses found‚Äù and total 0.
- Q: Table columns minimal set? ‚Üí A: Date, Category, Amount.
 - Note: Category dropdown is dynamically populated from the current in-memory expense entries.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: The UI MUST provide inputs to filter by month (numeric 1‚Äì12) and category via a dropdown of known categories.
- FR-006: Category dropdown MUST be populated from the unique set of categories present in the current expense data (deduplicated, sorted alphabetically), and include an "All" option.
- FR-002: The UI MUST display a table of filtered expenses with columns: Month, Category, Amount.
- FR-003: The UI MUST show a total amount for the currently filtered results.
- FR-003a: When 0 items match, the UI MUST display text "No expenses found" and show total 0.
- FR-004: The UI MUST import and reuse business logic from `src/expense/core.js`; no duplication in the frontend.
- FR-005: The UI MUST update the table and total reactively when filters change.

### Key Entities
- Expense item: { month: integer (1‚Äì12), category: string, amount: number }
- Category options: derived from expense data (unique categories, sorted; includes "All").

# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"

- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
