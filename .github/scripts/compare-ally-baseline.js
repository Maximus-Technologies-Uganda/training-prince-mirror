 * Placeholder: Compare accessibility scan results against baseline
 * 
 * This is a placeholder implementation for Chapter 6 Day 0.
 * Actual implementation will:
 * 1. Load baseline from .github/accessibility/ally-check-baseline.json
 * 2. Load scan results from .github/accessibility/scan-results.json
 * 3. Identify NEW violations not in the baseline
 * 4. Fail (exit 1) if new violations found, pass (exit 0) if only known violations
 * 
 * To be fully implemented in Chapter 6 Day 1.
