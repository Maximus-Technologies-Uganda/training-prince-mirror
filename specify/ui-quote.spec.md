# UI Quote

## Why
[cite_start]User wants to view a random quote and optionally filter by author. [cite: 146]

## Non-goals
[cite_start]No persistence; no external APIs this week. [cite: 148]

## Acceptance
- [ ] [cite_start]Default view shows a quote on load. [cite: 150]
- [ ] [cite_start]Typing an author filters quotes (case-insensitive). [cite: 151]
- [ ] [cite_start]Error state is displayed when author not found. [cite: 152]
- [ ] [cite_start]Keyboard focus order is logical; button labels accessible. [cite: 153]
