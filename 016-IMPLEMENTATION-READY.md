## 📋 How to Create Linear Sub-Issues

**Quick 5-step process:**

1. **Go to GitHub Actions:**
   - https://github.com/Maximus-Technologies-Uganda/training-prince/actions

2. **Find the workflow:**
   - Look for "Create Linear Sub-Issues (Generic)"

3. **Run the workflow:**
   - Click "Run workflow ▼"
   - Enter Parent Issue ID: `PRI-1514`
   - Enter Tasks File: `specs/016-week-4-finisher/tasks.md`

4. **Execute:**
   - Click the green "Run workflow" button
   - Wait ~1 minute for completion

5. **Verify:**
   - Check Linear for 15 new sub-issues under PRI-1514
   - All tasks linked with dependencies ✅

## 🔑 Key Features

### Coverage Configuration
- **Global Thresholds**: 60/50/60/60 (statements/branches/functions/lines)
- **Enforcement**: Hard block (no override mechanism)
- **Scope**: Uniform across entire codebase

### Exclusion Patterns (9 total)
- `**/node_modules/**` - Third-party code
- `**/dist/**`, `**/build/**` - Build artifacts
- `**/review-artifacts/**` - Review metadata
- `**/*.test.js`, `**/*.spec.js`, `**/*.spec.ts` - Test files
- `**/coverage/**` - Coverage reports
- `**/.git/**` - Git metadata

### CI Integration
- ✅ Coverage check step in checks.yml
- ✅ Hard block merge prevention
- ✅ Artifacts preserved on failure
- ✅ 30-day retention

### Review-Packet Integration
- ✅ Coverage artifacts copied to review-artifacts/
- ✅ Summary table in index.html
- ✅ 60-day retention for history
- ✅ Readable + machine-readable formats
