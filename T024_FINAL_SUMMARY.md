## Coverage Analysis

### Well-Covered Areas (>75%)
1. **models.js (100%)** - Data models, validators, and derivation functions
2. **exporter.js (94.68%)** - CSV export with proper formatting
3. **stopwatch-ui.js (80.84%)** - Main StopwatchUI class and event handlers
4. **persistence.js (75.72%)** - localStorage state management

### Moderate Coverage (50-75%)
1. **index.js (50.36%)** 
   - UI event handlers and DOM integration
   - Uncovered: Lines 364-423, 432-455 (complex DOM interactions)
   - Note: These are challenging to test in jsdom, does not impact requirement

2. **utils.js (65%)**
   - Utility functions and formatting
   - Uncovered: Lines 28-43 (edge cases)

### Not Covered
- **clock.js (0%)** - Currently unused in test suite

## Validation Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Coverage â‰¥40% | âœ… Pass | 73.92% achieved |
| All tests passing | âœ… Pass | 287/287 tests |
| Contract tests pass | âœ… Pass | 43/43 TDD tests |
| No console errors | âœ… Pass | Core module clean |
| Report generated | âœ… Pass | HTML + text reports |

## Conclusion

### âœ… Task T024 Successfully Completed

The ui-stopwatch module achieves **73.92% statement coverage**, which significantly exceeds the minimum requirement of **40%**. All 287 tests pass, including all contract tests that validate the implementation against its specification.

**No additional tests are required** to meet the coverage threshold. The implementation is well-tested and production-ready.
